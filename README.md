# Chinese IP Camera Information Repository

In this repo lives everything we know, have pulled off of, and plan to push onto a cheap Chinese IP Camera.  If I ever acquire the link for purchasing the camera, I will put it here.  Until then, I don't know where it came from.

## General Structure

```
CDROM      : Files that have been cloned or obtained form the accompanying CD-ROM disk
cam_src    : Files that have been cloned or obtained from the camera itself
datasheets : Datasheets regarding (parts of) the camera board
tools      : Misc. tools that are useful for the RE process

## Tools
