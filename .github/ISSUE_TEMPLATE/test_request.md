**This is a request for information issue**

I would like to know [what happens when/the value of/the contents of/other] *something*.

The test I would like to be run is:  

```bash
# ping 192.168.10.1
```

I [think/do not think] this will require root privileges on the client machine.

Is there any chance that this will cause damage/in some way alter the code executing on the camera?
[yes/no and why.  If yes, then what?]

Does this test prelude/follow up on others?  If so, what?
